## Description
This application is to take users password requirements and generate random password. Giving them the ability to ensure their credentials are secure and not having to come up with a seemingly random password on their own. This application allows the user to choose whether their credentials will contain Lowercase, Uppercase, Numeric, and Special Characters, as well as a length of 8 to 128 characters.

Motivation / Inspiration: 
- My motivation when building this application was to remove a lot of unneccessary code, and use other methods to achieve the same work with less lines / repeatative code. I wanted to push myself and my knowledge base to see how simple I would be able to make this application without losing functionality.
